This is a database migration repository.

/!\ WARNING: the content of this CONST_migration directory should not be
    manually updated. You should update the c2cgeoportal "update" template
    instead, and apply this template on the current project.

Add a new script:
    ./buildout/bin/manage_db script "Explicite name"

This will generate the migration script in
myproject/CONST_migration/versions/xxx_Explicite_name.py
You should *NOT* commit the script in this directory because this migration
script should be shared with all c2cgeoportal projects.
It is the c2cgeoportal "update" template which is responsible for updating
this directory.

So then customize the migration to suit your needs, and move it to the
c2cgeoportal "update" template, in
paste_templates/update/+package+/CONST_migration/versions/
